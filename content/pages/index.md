    title: "Hi, We're Geeky Owls!"
    content: >
      GeekyOwls is a small indie studio, with only 2 members - Tzur & Nofar, a happy and geeky couple.
      We have a pretty short history!

    We, Tzur & Nofar, are both gamers - Tzur is a software developer, Nofar is an Information Security researcher working toward her MSc in Neuroscience.
    We both love playing games, but never really thought of trying to create them (even though, Tzur created a small platformer game in order to propose to Nofar!)

    During the birth of our son, we had a cool game design idea. What started as a labor room talk to distract, became an actual game design doc, where several weeks after the initial shock of parenthood, we started developing it.
    Quickly, we had a working game loop, and things are looking great!

    Join us in our cool journey!

      In this blog/site I'll document and share interesting projects, updates
      about the,  "diagnose me" game development process, and a bit of my
      experience being an avid developer and a gamer.


      I'll also, occasionally, remind the internet that I'm a **very** new & a
      happy dad
